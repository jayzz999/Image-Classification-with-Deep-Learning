# Image Classification with Deep Learning: Getting Started

This project demonstrates a basic image classification pipeline using deep learning. It covers all key stages — from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and visualization — making it an excellent starting point for beginners in computer vision.

## Project Overview

The notebook walks through how to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images. It includes loading datasets, defining and training a model, evaluating performance, visualizing results, and saving the trained model for later inference.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing (resizing, normalization, batching)
- CNN model definition and training loop
- Evaluation and accuracy tracking (train/validation)
- Visualizations: loss & accuracy curves, sample predictions, confusion matrix
- Model saving and re-loading for inference
- Modular structure to easily modify datasets or model architectures

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch or TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
